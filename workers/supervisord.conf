; Point the command to the specific rq command you want to run.
; If you use virtualenv, be sure to point it to

command=/usr/local/bin/rq worker -P /usr/src/workers -c settings

; process_num is required if you specify >1 numprocs
process_name=worker-%(process_num)s

; If you want to run more worker instances, increase this

; This is the directory from which RQ is run. Be sure to point this to the
; directory where your source code is importable from
